# RailCut

This repository contains a recursive Python program designed to find the optimal way to cut rails based on available lengths and required portions. The program was created for the RATP (French public transport company).

## Features
- Recursive algorithm for finding optimal rail cuts
- Efficient solution for minimizing waste

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Run `RailCut.py`** using Python 3.x.
3. **Input required data**: Provide the lengths of available rails and the portion you need to cut.
4. **The program** will output the optimal cut solution.
